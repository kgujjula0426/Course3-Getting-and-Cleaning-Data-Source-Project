Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment Project: CodeBook.md

The code book contains all the information about the given source data, 
various steps and all the variable information of the final cleaned up and tidy data set

Data Source

Code Analysis

Data sets from Test and Train are loaded first. The second step is to merge the two data sets.
The next step is to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, use descriptive activity names and finally
we create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Please refer to the R script, [run_analysis.R]
